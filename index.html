        Despite a great increase in literacy rates throughout the world in recent years, there is still a large issue regarding literacy rates, especially in undeveloped or developing countries.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is higher literacy rate important?</h2>
    <p class="info">
        Literacy rate is a good measure to determine the level of education that a nation is able to provide to its people. Understanding what nations still need to provide better education is key in improving schooling for everyone.
